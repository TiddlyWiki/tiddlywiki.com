~TiddlyWiki "Classic" uses ~TiddlyWiki5-based tools to assemble and output the core system, rather than the Ruby-based ginsu/cook utilities that were previously used.  The ability of ~TiddlyWiki5 to directly create ~TiddlyWiki Classic documents ensures a robust and reliable future for the existing "installed base" of ~TiddlyWiki, even as the community migrates to using the new power and flexiblity of ~TiddlyWiki5.
