This revision includes the following changes:
*{{block{
Backstage>import: now uses ~HTML5 "~FileReader" API whenever available (currently supported by Chrome, ~FireFox 20+, etc.).  See https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/tiddlywiki/issues/116.

You can now successfully ''//select and import files that are outside of the current folder.//''  Note: this change only applies when you use the "browse" (or "select file") button to choose a document from your local filesystem.   If you manually enter (or paste) a local "file://" URL into the import form, the previous "loadFile" local file I/O handling is used, which requires the ~TiddlyFox addon (for ~FireFox 15+), or the ~TiddlySaver java applet (for Chrome, Safari, and other Webkit-based browsers).  Internet Explorer uses it's own native "~ActiveX" file I/O functions.
}}}
*{{block{
Internet Explorer: when using ~IE10 (or above), special-case handling of embedded newlines in ~PRE-formatted blocks is no longer applied.  See https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/tiddlywiki/issues/118.

This corrects a formatting/display error introduced by changes in ~IE10. Special handling is still applied to embedded newlines in IE9 and earlier.
}}}
